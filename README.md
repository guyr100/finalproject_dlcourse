Full project code is availble in the jupiter notebook.
If you run the code, please make sure don't use "save_in_drive" option as it will save all models in your drive.
There's an example of training loop with VGG models (10 epochs)
Our models were loaded from Google drive. The final models are not attached as each model is over 1GB.
Enjoy!
